## Makefile Commands

| Command           | Description                                     |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `make setup`      | Creates virtual environment and installs deps   |
| `make run`        | Launches the application                        |
| `make clean`      | Removes virtual environment and build files     |
| `make freeze`     | Freezes current dependencies to `requirements.txt` |
| `make build-linux`| Builds standalone Linux executable using PyInstaller |

## How to Use

1. Fill in all AWS credentials:
   - AWS Region
   - Access Key ID
   - Secret Access Key
   - Bucket Name
2. Select the folder containing the files.
3. Optionally check **Save credentials** to reuse them next time.
4. Click **Start Upload**.
5. Monitor the progress bar until upload completes.

---

## Behind the Scenes

- Uploads are done using `ThreadPoolExecutor` for parallelism.
- Only file files are uploaded.
- S3 bucket is auto-created if it doesn’t already exist.

---

## Local Config (Optional)

If the **Save credentials** checkbox is enabled, the app stores your AWS details and bucket name in a local file (`config.json`). These values will be automatically restored on the next launch.

## Not Implemented

- Time remaining estimation (removed due to inaccuracy)
- Drag-and-drop support
